# ETC-5543-Zap-Anomaly-Detection
This is the GitHub repository for the ETC:5543 Internship Project of Kumar Vatsal and Dhruv Nirmal.

This repository contains the presentation for the project and the python script which was used to generate the plots and figures shown in the presentation.

This repository also contains the final report for the project and the required files to reproduce the analysis once the access for the data is obtained.


To reproduce the analysis, the user must gain access to the database from VCDI and then load the data in the python scripts. Then Run the combination.py file. 
On running this function, the output will be a table that contains the **top 20 anomalies** for every month across all the matrices.
